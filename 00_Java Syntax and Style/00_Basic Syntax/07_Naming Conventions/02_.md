Let's review three common naming conventions of which examples can be found in the code. Moving forward, let us remember and implement the following naming conventions.

1. lowerCamelCase:<br>

     Name is formed with multiple words that are joined together as a single word, with the first letter of each of the multiple words (except the first one) capitalized. Used for method names, non-constant field names, and parameter names.

2. UpperCamelCase:<br>

     Name is formed of multiple words that are joined together as a single word, with the first letter of each of the multiple words capitalized. Used for class names.

3. CONSTANT\_CASE:<br>

     Name is formed with every letter of each word in uppercase letters, with words separated by underscores. Only used for constants. (We will learn about constants later in the course.)
