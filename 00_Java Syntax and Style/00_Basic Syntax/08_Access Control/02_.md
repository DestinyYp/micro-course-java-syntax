When a variable's or method's access is not specified `public` or `private`, it will have default visibility. Default visibility is packaged private; it is visible to all classes in the same package. It is best to declare members `public` if that is the true intent. If an instance variable is declared `private`, it can only be used by the methods of that class. In the preceding example, `AccessControlTest` has its own `private` variable that is not accessible by the main method of the `AccessControlExample` class.

Access control allows other users to use your program without ever accessing, altering, or even knowing that the private variables or methods exist.
