>>Which one of these method declarations is incorrect? <<

( ) <pre><code>static int exampleMethod()</code></pre> {{Incorrect because a method does not require the access modifier <code>public</code> in the method header.}}
( ) <pre><code>public int exampleMethod (int paramOne, int paramTwo)</code></pre> {{Incorrect because it has a return type, a method name, and two parameters in the correct format.}}
( ) <pre><code>private void exampleMethod()</code></pre> {{Incorrect because it has a return type <code>void</code> and a method name.}}
( ) <pre><code>public static int exampleMethod()</code></pre> {{Incorrect because methods can also be declared static.}}
(x) <pre><code>private void (String paramOne)</code></pre> {{Correct because methods have to include a return type as well as a method name. All the other modifiers are not necessary when creating a method.}}
