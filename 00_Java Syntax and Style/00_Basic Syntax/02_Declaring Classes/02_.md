The class `ClassExample` is an example of a class declaration. The area between the braces is called the class body and provides all the code information within a certain class.

Please remember that if you are planning to run the class, the main method must exist and be declared exactly the same as it is show above. The class is separated into three different sections:

1. Fields: contains variables that are declared or declared and initialized with a value
2. Constructors: initialize the objects of a particular class. We will dive deeper into this concept when we examine and discuss objects 
3. Methods: sets of code that are referred to by name and called upon at any point in the program.
