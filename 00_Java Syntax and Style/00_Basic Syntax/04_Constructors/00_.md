We mentioned constructors when we discussed declaring classes and we will visit this topic again later. For now, let's discuss what a constructor is and what it does. If a class is a description of a possible object, then the constructor is what functions to create the object of the class.

Constructors are often used with values called parameters that are stored in the data portion of the object that is created. Take a look at the program below. `String parameterOne` is the parameter of the constructor. The name of the constructor has to match the name of the class.
