Each class has at least one constructor. In the case that the programmer does not write a constructor definition, Java will produce a default constructor for that class. The default constructor will only perform the following basics: allocate memory and initialize instance variables. If we want more to happen when an object is created, we can include one or more constructors in the class definition. When declaring a constructor, remember that a constructor does not have any return type, not even `void`, so the header of the constructor should look something like this: `public ClassName()`.
