In our example above, we see that the reserved words are in a different color than the rest of the line. These are words that have a specific meaning to the system. For example, `class` means that a definition of "class" immediately follows. We must use reserved words only for their intended purpose; we cannot use "class" for any other purpose than defining class.

Please notice that the Java reserved word must be written in the exact same way as Java states, including the case of the word. For this reason, even though it is not recommended, we could technically name a variable "Class" because the 'C' is capitalized so it is not our reserved word `class`.

The following are more examples of reserved words that we will learn how to use as we progress through the course.

`abstract`, `if`, `private`, `this`, `double`, `implements`, `throw`, `boolean`, `else`, `import`, `public`, `throws`, `break`, `return`, `byte`, `extends`, `int`, `short`, `true`, `false`, `case`, `interface`, `static`, `try`, `catch`, `final`, `long`, `void`.
