In the example above, some comments span for more than one line. To get the Java compiler to ignore multiple lines, we use `/*` at the beginning of the comment and `*/` at the end of the numerous lines of comments. When using this method to add a lengthy comment, make sure there are no characters between '/' and '\*'. The `/*` and `*/` can start and stop anywhere on a line. Everything between the pair is a comment ignored by the compiler.

In addition to marking an actual comment in this way, we can also use the comment functionality for debugging. If we run into a situation where the program has a syntax error, one way to search for the root of the error is to remove some of the code from being compiled by turning it into a comment. If the modified program works as expected, the error must be in the section of code that was made into a comment. From there, we can decrease the amount of code in the comments until we pinpoint the error. Please remember this useful and important method for debugging long lines of code.
